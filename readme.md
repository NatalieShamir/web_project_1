# Learning how to learn

## Description
Learning how to learn is a one-page website, consisting of 11 blocks overall, including header and footer. It was created as a project in a Practicum 100 web-development course I'm participating in. 

## Technologies and Techniques Used
* HTML5 and CSS were used to write the code
* [BEM Methodology](https://en.bem.info/) was implemented. Tag selectors are not used at all, instead class selectors that represent BEM entities are. All files are organized according to [BEM File Structure](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/#file-structure). All CSS files are imported into a corresponding file page. The section-title, section-subtitle and two-columns sections are reused throughout the project as per the brief requirement.
